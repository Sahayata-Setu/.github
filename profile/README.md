# Sahayata Setu

Sahayata Setu is a mobile application designed to connect donors and beneficiaries through an efficient and transparent donation management system. Developed during the *Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav Hackathon 2022*, it won an appreciation award from the *Education Department (Higher & Technical), Government of Gujarat* in March 2023. Created by a team from *Marwadi University*, Sahayata Setu facilitates effective donation management and tracking by allowing donors to post items for donation and respond to requests, while beneficiaries can claim donations and express their needs. Additionally, NGOs and volunteers can create and manage campaigns, extending the app's impact by organizing larger distribution efforts.
